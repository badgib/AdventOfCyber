My little log of tasks for future reference and whatnot

### DAY ONE ###
Day one was a mostly pretty nicely put introduction to the environment and OPSEC in general. The tasks at hand required use of `file` and `exiftool` to gather information. We had to try figuring out stuff from github profiles and whatnot and learned how to go deeper by figuring out where the crumbles go to figure out the 'identity' of the character. It's starting to look it's going to be a fun little story.
